# NLP Binary Classification
This is the Repository for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for NLP Binary Classification. The objective of case study is to compare various models with minimal feature engineering techniques.

## Data Description
The dataset is obtained from standford archive (http://ai.stanford.edu). This dataset contains movie reviews posted by people on the IMDb website, as well as the corresponding labels (“positive” or “negative”) indicating whether the reviewer liked the movie or not. This is a classic example of a sentiment analysis problem.

## Code

The solution is split into Exploratory data analysis and Model Building. 

Exploratory data analysis results are stored in below notebook.

1. `Exploratory data analysis.ipynb`

Below are the notebooks for Models:

1. `Machine Learning - Model 1.ipynb` 
2. `Deep Learning - Model 1.ipyb`

You need to have [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) installed to run the file

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Run

To run the notebook, open terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `NLP-Binary-Classification-1/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Exploratory data analysis.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Exploratory data analysis.ipynb
```
